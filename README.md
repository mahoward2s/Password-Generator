# Password-Generator

<!--Description of Password Generator-->
I created a password generator that will automatically and randomly assigns you a password depending on your criteria selection.

You have the option to choose between 8 and 128 password length.

You have the options to choose uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters as long as one is selected.

Then when you have made your selections it will randomly assign you a password with your criteria.
